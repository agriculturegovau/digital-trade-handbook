We design and build services to meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria).

The criteria and process follow human-centred thinking and agile ways of working. They help us create easy, fast, reliable and valuable services.

Teams work through the 5-stage service design and delivery process:

- [Mobilisation](./mobilisation) - establish teams and remove blockers to start Discovery stage.
- [Discovery stage](./discovery) - teams get deep understanding of people, problems and context, and develop hypotheses.
- [Alpha stage](./alpha) - an experimental stage; teams use prototypes to test hypotheses.
- [Beta stage](./beta) - teams build an end-to-end service based on what they learn in the Alpha stage.
- [Live stage](./live) - teams maintain and improve the service.

The stages build on each other but they do not always go in order.

For example, a team working on a service in Beta may move into a new Discovery stage to work on a different problem.
