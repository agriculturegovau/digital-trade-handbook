## Getting started

This handbook is for:

The handbook describes the default way that we do things in our teams, to help you get started faster.

2. Understand our [service transformation strategy](./strategy/).
3. Find out why we work in [multidisciplinary delivery teams](./teams/).
4. Find out how we apply the Digital Service Standard and follow the [service design and delivery process](./service-design-delivery-process/).
