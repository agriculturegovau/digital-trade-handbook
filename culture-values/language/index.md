This is a list of words we avoid, and why.

These words are harmful or confusing for people. You can usually find a different word that is more effective.

- ceremonies (use 'events'; there are no one set of mandatory ceremonies or rituals in agile)
- combating
- commit/pledge (we need to be more specific - we’re either doing something or we’re not)
- facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you’re helping)
- guys (use 'people' or 'team' instead)
- impact (do not use this as a synonym for have an effect on, or influence)
- key (unless it unlocks something; a subject/thing is not key, it’s probably important)
- portal (we build services that work together, not silos)
- progress (as a verb - what are you actually doing?)
- project (we work on 'products' and 'services' that we support and maintain)
- tackling (unless it’s rugby, football or some other sport)
- transforming (what are you actually doing to change it?)
- user testing (we test products and services, not people)
