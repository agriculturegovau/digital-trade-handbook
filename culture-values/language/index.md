This is a list of word and terms that can cause problems in our work, and why.

For general style guidance, use the [department style guide on the intranet](https://ausgovenvironment.sharepoint.com/sites/AWE-intranet/SitePages/Forms-and-templates.aspx).

Please suggest other terms that should go here: [capability.team@agriculture.gov.au](mailto:capability.team@agriculture.gov.au). Also please reach out if we can make any of this material clearer.

## Inclusive language

The words we use reflect and reinforce what we believe about the world.

Even though we don't mean it, using certain words can hurt others.

We aren't perfect. But if we can use a different word, it can help to make everyone's daily interactions easier.

### Guys - use 'people' or 'team' instead

Using 'guys' to refer to everyone in a room or on a call promotes the expectation that the male gender is the default.

Technology, ICT, design and other industries continue to suffer from gender imbalance. It's important to help address this.

Even if everyone in a group looks male, it doesn't mean they all are.

### Resources - only use for things, never people

Referring to people as 'resources' is demeaning and inaccurate.

We should never suggest people are like objects.

## Delivery terms

Some words create confusion about how we work. Try to avoid these terms.

### Agile ceremonies - use 'events' instead

There is no one set of mandatory ceremonies or rituals in agile.

(And 'ceremonies' and 'rituals' sound a bit creepy, frankly.)

### Portals - we are building a service instead

We are building Taking Farmers to Market as a single service. It will include shared microservices.

Portals are single monolithic websites. They can make it harder for people to do everything they need to do. A portal will never include everything a person needs to do in every circumstance.

Portals can also be too complex for a person to use, because they offer many things in the one place.

### Projects - we build and maintain 'products' and 'services'

A 'project' is something with a fixed start and finish date.

When we talk about the things we are building, we prefer to use 'products' and 'services'. These are things we support and maintain as long as they are helpful to the people who use them.

Some tools and processes we use refer to 'projects'. It's important remember we are responsible for maintaining the things we deliver.

### User testing - we test things, not people

Using 'user testing' suggests we are testing people; what is wrong with them? Why did they "fail" to use our thing? Instead we need to  be open to the problems with our ideas and our things.

The difference appears subtle, but it is vital. We can't improve unless we approach research and testing with openness and empathy.

## Plain language

::: alert
We must make our service easy to understand and use so it available to everyone who needs it.

This is a [requirement of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/user-needs/accessibility-and-inclusion/agency-responsibilities-and-commitments#other_accessibility_guidance_and_standards).
:::

People prefer language that is familiar and easy to understand, so they can get things done.

Try to use plain everyday words and terms, instead of complex jargon.

This helps the people using the service we are building, as we as our team members working on it.
