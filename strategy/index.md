title: Digital transformation strategy
order: 2
---

We prioritise building the foundations of a complete experience first.

If we build out our new capabilities block-by-block, we risk building services that reflect our own structures, not what users are trying to do. This also takes longer to get new services into the hands of users, increasing our risk.

Instead - we prioritise steel threads that span the whole user experience. On that foundation we deliver more complex user journeys.

These principles guide our decisions for delivery:
* Focus on **user needs** even over internal requirements.
* Prioritise **direct user value** even over generic capabilities.
* Deliver **smaller, quicker increments** even over larger, complex releases.
* Make **longer-term product and tech decisions** even over short-term fixes.

## Beyond digitisation and digitalisation
<!--
Tom Loosemore, co-founder of the UK Government Digital Service, defined 'digital' as:
> applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet era to respond to peopleâ€™s raised expectations.
-->
When we talk about 'digital transformation' we do not mean just 'digitisation' or 'digitalisation':
- 'Digitisation' is about going from an analogue to digital format (for example, a paper form to a PDF).
- 'Digitalisation' is using digital technology to change business model and processes.

'Digital transformation' is about improving people's experiences by building services that meet their needs. 

This means improving the whole experiences for people, not individual parts. It also requires us to improve the platforms and experience of people in government that support the service.

An example of the different levels:
1. Digitisation: "Welcome to the online version of our paper form. Your permit will be issues by mail in 30 days."
2. Digitalisation: "We've redesigned our operations. Everything is more efficient and smooth. Thanks for using our online form. Here's your permit."
3. Digital transformation: "No more form - we've got data from other agencies you deal with. We've determined your risk level and you don't need a permit. By the way, you also qualify for this grant."

## Human-centred design

We follow human-centred design. This means we involve the people we are designing for in every stage of the process.

We start with developing empathy for people. We test lots of ideas (hypotheses) with these people to work out what we should build. 

As we build, we keep testing our service with people to make sure we're building the right thing. When we release we keep listening to people to work out how to make the service better.

## Design thinking

## Agile approaches

We use agile approaches, rather than one fixed framework.

Agile is an umbrella term that refers to frameworks, practices, processes and mindsets. What they have in common is their intent to:

* optimise work to create the greatest value
* identify and adapt to change
* keep on improving.

Agile frameworks are generally used by teams. But agile can scale from individuals to multinational organisations.

Teams that follow agile approaches work in the open. This means they encourage engagement, validation and feedback of their work. As a result, teams build from an evidence-based foundation. They also refine their approach based on new knowledge.

Agile works for many different things. This includes, policy, education, manufacturing, military and other specialist fields.
