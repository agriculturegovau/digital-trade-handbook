## Getting started

This handbook is by the Taking Farmers to Markets service teams. This service is part of [Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.awe.gov.au/). The department is part of the Australian Government.

This is for:
* people in the department working with digital delivery teams
* digital specialists who join our product teams, like developers, designers and user researchers
* anyone in government who wants to develop their ways of working.

The handbook describes the default way that we do things in our digital teams, to help you get started faster.

## Principles of digital delivery

When we talk about 'digital' we do not mean 'digitisation' (for example, scanning a paper form and emailing it).

Tom Loosemore, co-founder of the UK Government Digital Service, defined digital as:
> applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet era to respond to peopleâ€™s raised expectations.

Digital is about transforming people's experiences by building services that meet their needs. This means improving the whole experience of a user, not individual parts. It also requires us to improve the platforms and experience of people in government that support the service.

### Decision making framework
We prioritise building the foundation of a complete experience. On that foundation we will deliver more complex user journeys.

Our guide rails:
* **Focus on user needs** even over internal requirements.
* **Prioritise direct user value** even over generic capabilities.
* **Deliver smaller, quicker increments** even over larger, complex releases.
* **Make longer-term product and tech decisions** even over short-term fixes.

### Digital Service Standard

We design and build services to meet the 13 criteria of the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria).

These criteria follow human-centred thinking and agile ways of working. They help us create easy, fast, reliable and valuable services.

## Service design and delivery process

Teams follow a 4-stage service design and delivery process:

* Discovery stage - the team gets a deep understanding of users and their needs, and develop hypotheses to solve the problems
* Alpha stage - the team builds prototypes to test the hypotheses.
* Beta stage - the team builds and tests a solution based on the hypotheses validated in Alpha.
* Live stage - the team maintains and improves the service.

The stages build on each other but they do not always go in order. For example, a team working on a service in Beta may start a new Discovery stage to work on a different problem.

## Agile approaches

We use agile approaches.

Agile is an umbrella term that refers to frameworks, practices, processes and mindsets. What they have in common is their intent to:

* optimise work to create the greatest value
* identify and adapt to change
* keep on improving.

Agile frameworks are generally used by teams. But agile can scale from individuals to multinational organisations.

Teams that follow agile approaches work in the open.

This means they encourage engagement, validation and feedback of their work. As a result their work is build with an evidence-based foundation. They also refine their approach based on new knowledge.

Agile is not only for software products or projects. Teams use agile in policy, education, change and enablement, product development, manufacturing, military and other specialist fields.

## Roles in multidisciplinary teams

We work in multidisciplinary teams. This means the teams have all the roles needed to build and run a user-centred service. They have the power to make decisions about how to design and deliver the service.

### Core roles
There are 7 core roles in a multidisciplinary team:

* product manager
* delivery manager
* service designer
* user researcher
* content designer
* interaction designer
* developer.

The roles and people in teams may change during the stages of the service design and delivery process. But the team will always be multidisciplinary.

### User research is a team sport

Everyone in our teams are part of watching and analysing research with real users.

User researchers work with the rest of the team on design decisions and prototypes.

## Contribution and reuse

This is a work in progress.

You can help contribute to the handbook. See our guide to [editing the handbook](./about-handbook/editing/).

We work in the open.

This makes it easier for our teams and partners to access, and easier for everyone to contribute to. You are free to adapt and reuse this content under the [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
