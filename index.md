## Getting started

This handbook is by the Taking Farmers to Markets service teams. This service is part of [Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.awe.gov.au/). The department is part of the Australian Government.

This is for:
* people in the department working with digital delivery teams
* digital specialists who join our product teams, like developers, designers and user researchers
* anyone in government who wants to develop their ways of working.

The handbook describes the default way that we do things in our digital teams, to help you get started faster.

## Principles for digital design and delivery

When we talk about 'digital' we do not mean 'digitisation' (for example, scanning a paper form and emailing it).

Tom Loosemore, co-founder of the UK Government Digital Service, defined digital as:
> applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet era to respond to peopleâ€™s raised expectations.

Digital is about transforming people's experiences by building services that meet their needs. This means improving the whole experiences for people, not individual parts. It also requires us to improve the platforms and experience of people in government that support the service.

### Human-centred design

We follow human-centred design. This means we involve the people we are designing for in every stage of the process.

We start with developing empathy for people. We test lots of ideas (hypotheses) with these people to work out what we should build. 

As we build, we keep testing our service with people to make sure we're building the right thing. When we release we keep listening to people to work out how to make the service better.

### Guide rails for decisions
We prioritise building the foundation of a complete experience. On that foundation we will deliver more complex user journeys.

Our guide rails:
* **Focus on user needs** even over internal requirements.
* **Prioritise direct user value** even over generic capabilities.
* **Deliver smaller, quicker increments** even over larger, complex releases.
* **Make longer-term product and tech decisions** even over short-term fixes.

### Digital Service Standard

We design and build services to meet the 13 criteria of the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria).

These criteria follow human-centred thinking and agile ways of working. They help us create easy, fast, reliable and valuable services.

## Service design and delivery process <!-- add L1 -->

Teams follow a 5-stage service design and delivery process:

* Mobilisation - establish teams and remove blockers to start discovery.
* Discovery stage - teams get deep understanding of people, problems and context, and develop hypotheses.
* Alpha stage - an experimental stage; teams use prototypes to test hypotheses.
* Beta stage - teams build an end-to-end service based on what they learn in the Alpha stage.
* Live stage - teams maintain and improve the service.

The stages build on each other but they do not always go in order. For example, a team working on a service in Beta may start a new Discovery stage to work on a different problem.

Different teams work on seperate parts of a service. To stay aligned on the complete service, we have:
* shared guides and tools (for example, the DAWE style guide, design system and this handbook)
* support from a central team of capability experts
* regular cross-team events, including showcases and guilds.

## Agile approaches <!-- add L1 -->

We use agile approaches, rather than one fixed framework.

Agile is an umbrella term that refers to frameworks, practices, processes and mindsets. What they have in common is their intent to:

* optimise work to create the greatest value
* identify and adapt to change
* keep on improving.

Agile frameworks are generally used by teams. But agile can scale from individuals to multinational organisations.

Teams that follow agile approaches work in the open. This means they encourage engagement, validation and feedback of their work. As a result, teams build from an evidence-based foundation. They also refine their approach based on new knowledge.

Agile works for many different things. This includes, policy, education, manufacturing, military and other specialist fields.

## Multidisciplinary teams, roles and skills <!-- add L1, mention T shape, what we mean and don't mean, SME inclusion -->

We work in multidisciplinary teams. A multidisciplinary team has the skills needed to understand and solve people's problems.

Everyone takes part in watching and analysing research with people so we develop empathy. This means we can make decisions grounded in the context of people and the problems they need to solve.

Usually these 7 core roles are in multidisciplinary teams:

* product manager
* delivery manager
* user researcher
* service designer
* content designer
* interaction designer
* developer.

Roles will change through the stages to make sure the team has the right skills and can keep learning.

## Contribution and reuse

We work on this handbook in the open. This makes it easier for our teams and partners to access, and easier for everyone to contribute to.

Working in the open means:
* This handbook is in progress and may change at any time.
* We regulary test the content with the teams that use it.
* All content is available for reuse with a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
* We are extending what already exits, rather than duplicating (including [Digital Transformation Agency's Digital Guides](https://guides.service.gov.au/).
* We welcome your contribution; see our guide to [editing the handbook](./about-handbook/editing/).
