title: Why agile?

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) sets out four principles for delivery:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
> **Responding to change** over following a plan

The manifesto originated as a better way to deliver software but its principles have been adopted in a wide range of non-technical use cases too.

For teams delivering user-centred digital products and services, working in an agile way provides many advantages over traditional delivery methodologies like waterfall or PRINCE2.

# Agile lets you release services to users earlier

Rather than waiting 3 or 4 years to deliver a polished, finished product to users for the first time, taking an agile approach requires you to deliver in small increments, early and often.

This means users get access to new government digital services in months, not years, and have the ability to provide feedback early on, at the time when the biggest design decisions are yet to be made.

We often launch new services as a [beta](../../service-design-delivery-process/beta/), which makes clear to users and stakeholders that the service is new and still being improved.

# Agile helps you better adapt as you go

By not planning everything upfront, and by focussing on the delivery of the smallest increment of value, you have greater flexibility to change and adapt as you go.

Working in a sprint, you'll have regular opportunities to reshape, recalibrate and reprioritise based on the things you've learned from delivery so far.

This also means your stakeholders have more opportunities to get involved with the product, playing an active role in facilitating user research, prioritising the backlog, and measuring performance.

Even though your destination might change, you still need a goal, milestone, or other 'north star' to aim for.

High-performing teams chase outcomes, not deliverables - giving you the flexibility to change tack as you find out what actually solves the user need.

# Agile reduces the risk of technology failure

Traditional waterfall IT projects favour 'big bang' releases right at the end - which increases the risk that the technology simply might not work when it's operated in a real world environment.

By releasing smaller increments of software into production far earlier into the journey, and operating it for users with genuine needs, this risk is substantially reduced.

Further, by initially releasing software to a smaller cohort of users, or with only a subset of the overall functionality, you can prove your technology in a lower-risk environment before rolling out to a wider group of users.
