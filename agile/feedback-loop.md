title: The feedback loop
order: 1

The feedback loop is everything you do between identifying a problem to solve, designing and delivering a solution, and measuring how well the change you made met the user need.

To work effectively in an agile team, you need to understand your product's feedback loop, the factors that impact its length, and the actions you can take to reduce the size of the loop.


# Learning about the problem on the journey

In waterfall delivery approaches, you set out all your requirements at the start, at the point when you often know the least about the problem.

In contrast, taking an agile approach means you lock in as little as possible upfront and use what you learn along the way to shape your path.

Even designing and testing the smallest of ideas with users will offer valuable insights that will help you refine and recalibrate. Doing this over multiple years results in a product that's battle-tested with real users.

This requires a different approach to delivery, in mindset, planning and technology. At the heart, it's all about planning for your plans to change.


# Shorter feedback loops reduce risk
