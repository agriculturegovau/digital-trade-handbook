The delivery manager is responsible for making sure the team is set up to deliver.

Their role includes:

* helping the team to create an environment of continuous improvement
* making sure what's in the backlog can be delivered
* removing blockers and obstacles for the team
* supporting governance, finances, resourcing and procurement

Delivery managers often help facilitate [regular team agile ceremonies](#), like sprint planning and retrospectives.


# Delivery managers are not project managers

It's common to conflate the role of delivery manager with the traditional role of IT project manager.

Compared to a project manager, delivery managers:

* are part of the team [for the long haul](../../#the-unit-of-delivery-is-the-team), not just a single project
* play an enabling role for the team over directing the work
* are responsible for the ways of working and team health, not just the timeframes and deliverables


# Supporting continuous improvement
