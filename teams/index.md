title: Delivery teams
order: 3

A multidisciplinary team (MDT) has the skills needed to understand and solve people's problems.

Organisations traditionally put people with similar skills in the same functional areas. MDTs break these silos by combining people form different disciplines.

Why we work in MDTs:
- A broad range of skills and roles and quick decision-making processes mean the team can change and adapt as the service evolves.
- Teams can efficiently grow and retract as the service moves into different phases of development.
- Team members are given opportunities to stretch their own skill sets by working closely with other disciplines.

MDTs follow human-centred design practices and agile approaches.

* user researcher
* service designer
* content designer
