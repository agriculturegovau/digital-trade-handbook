title: The delivery team
order: 2

We work in multi-disciplinary delivery teams - teams of cross-functional specialists who work together to deliver a product or service.

Typically, our teams:

* are co-located together
* are empowered to make decisions about the product or service
* have all the roles in the team to scope, design and deliver a feature or improvement

Teams are led by a [product manager](./roles/product-manager/) and [delivery manager](./roles/delivery-manager/).

Read more about [the roles in the team](./roles/).


# The unit of delivery is the team

Teams that deliver great services are those that collaborate together and share ownership, even over the contribution of any one individual team member.

This means that the whole team should take responsibility for things like:

* the user research
* the design of the service
* the quality of the code


# Most team members are full-time

Most people in a delivery team are committed to the team full-time.

Some team members, like [subject matter experts](./roles/suject-matter-expert/), may be part-time and considered "an extra hat to wear" in addition to your day-to-day role.

On a rare occasion, a team member might be shared between multiple delivery teams.


# Teams stay together

Where we can, we will set up ongoing teams to create and improve a product or service over a long period of time.

This means that the knowledge about the product or service and its users stays within the team.

It also helps the team to become well-practiced at working together to solve problems.
