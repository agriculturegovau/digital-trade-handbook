title: Beta

In Beta stage you focus on building the minimum viable product that you defined at the end of Alpha stage. This is the simplest thing you can build that meets the user need.

In Beta stage, the team builds an end-to-end service based on what they have learned in Alpha stage. They keep iterating until it is ready to test in a private Beta release and then a public Beta release.

You will keep testing the service with users first in a private Beta and then a public Beta.

## Finishing Beta
Your service is ready to move on to the Live stage when you are sure:
- it meets user needs and delivers the full end-to-end user journey
- you can support it and you will be able to keep iterating and improving it until itâ€™s retired
