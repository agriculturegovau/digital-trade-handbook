title: Service design and delivery process
order: 4
---

We design and build services to meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria).


Teams follow a 5-stage service design and delivery process:

* Mobilisation - establish teams and remove blockers to start discovery.
* Discovery stage - teams get deep understanding of people, problems and context, and develop hypotheses.
* Alpha stage - an experimental stage; teams use prototypes to test hypotheses.
* Beta stage - teams build an end-to-end service based on what they learn in the Alpha stage.
* Live stage - teams maintain and improve the service.

The stages build on each other but they do not always go in order. For example, a team working on a service in Beta may start a new Discovery stage to work on a different problem.

The criteria and process follow human-centred thinking and agile ways of working. They help us create easy, fast, reliable and valuable services.

Different teams work on separate parts of services. To stay aligned on complete services, we have:
* shared guides and tools (for example, the DAWE style guide, design system and this handbook)
* support from a central team of capability experts
* regular cross-team events, including showcases and guilds.
