title: Service design and delivery process
order: 1
---

Teams follow a 5-stage service design and delivery process:

* Mobilisation - establish teams and remove blockers to start discovery.
* Discovery stage - teams get deep understanding of people, problems and context, and develop hypotheses.
* Alpha stage - an experimental stage; teams use prototypes to test hypotheses.
* Beta stage - teams build an end-to-end service based on what they learn in the Alpha stage.
* Live stage - teams maintain and improve the service.

The stages build on each other but they do not always go in order. For example, a team working on a service in Beta may start a new Discovery stage to work on a different problem.
