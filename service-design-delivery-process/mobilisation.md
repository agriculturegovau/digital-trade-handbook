title: Mobilisation
order: 1

The purpose of Mobilisation is to establish teams and remove blockers to start discovery.

What to do in Mobilisation:
- have the right roles in the team and understand how a multidisciplinary team works
- understand human-centred design and why we need to own the whole user experience
- understand agile delivery and how you will do budgeting and reporting when using agile
- find stakeholders and subject matter experts
- have all relevant reviews and approvals in place for your proposed research, have started your user research plan and are ready to start researching straight away
understand the legislation, regulations and policies that may impact your service
- have an open space for the team to co-locate with internet access, IT systems and printers
- have purchased any equipment needed by the team (for example, laptops)

You need to do all of these things before you can start Discovery. If you don’t have everything ready to go, the team may be blocked for a long time. For example, ethical reviews and approvals on a user research plan might take several sprints of the team’s time.
- make sure there are the right capabilities in the team, and that you’ve highlighted any gaps - see the roles list earlier in the document for more detailed information on this
- know who your stakeholders and subject matter experts are, and schedule regular team time with them for the whole Discovery
- select a user research recruitment agency, so that the user researchers can start researching with users in the first couple of weeks start preparing your recruitment briefs as soon as you have identified your user base, finding actual representative users can take some time. Aim to include a participant with a physical or cognitive challenge in this.
- find a good, open space for the team to co-locate during Discovery - one with plenty of wall space and whiteboards - and bring lots of stationery: post-it notes, index cards and sharpie markers are a must
- check that all the building facilities are ready for the team: this includes access to the building, wifi, IT systems and printers
